            <p>Graphics are an essential part of multimedia, covering various non-text elements like photos, illustrations, drawings, clip art, icons, and even AI-generated images. These visuals are static, meaning they don’t move, but they work alongside text to make ideas clearer and more engaging. In multimedia, photos do more than just decorate; they can be featured in slideshows or galleries, giving users a chance to explore visually appealing content. Some graphics are also interactive, allowing users to click on them to access related elements, such as audio or video. Overall, graphics are widely used in multimedia to convey messages effectively and capture attention with eye-catching designs.</p><br>

            <p>Graphics are crucial in multimedia as they enhance communication by complementing text, clarifying ideas, and making content more engaging. Static visuals like photos, illustrations, and icons serve not just as decorative elements but also as tools to convey information and evoke emotions. Interactive graphics further enrich the user experience by linking to related content, such as audio or video. By presenting visually appealing and accessible designs, graphics capture attention, improve understanding, and create a more immersive and effective multimedia experience.</p><br>

            <p>The RGB color model explains how we mix red, green, and blue light to create the colors we see on screens, like TVs or phones. It works the same way our eyes perceive color through light. By changing the brightness of each of these three colors, we can make millions of different shades. When all three colors are turned up to their brightest, the result is white light. This system works well for devices like screens and projectors because they create colors by shining light. It’s like mixing paint, but instead of using physical colors, you’re using light!</p>

              <h2 id="cmyk"><span class="highlight">Bitmap </span>Graphics</h2>
              <p>A bitmap (or raster graphic) is a digital image made up of a grid of tiny dots, where each dot represents a single pixel on a screen. At 100% zoom, each dot aligns directly with a pixel on the display. In a typical bitmap image, each pixel can be assigned a unique color, and together, these pixels form a rectangular picture. Bitmap images come in various file formats. The standard uncompressed format is known as the BMP format or device-independent bitmap (DIB) format. BMP files include a header that specifies details like the image’s dimensions and the number of colors it uses, followed by a list of pixels with their color data. This format is widely supported across platforms, but because it is uncompressed, it is not very efficient for storing large images due to its large file size.</p>

            <h2 id="usevector">When to use Vector<span class = "highlight"> Graphics</span></h2>
            <p>Designers should use vector images when they need graphics that can be resized easily, like logos, icons, or illustrations. 
                Vector images are made using lines and shapes defined by math,
                 so they can be scaled up or down without losing quality. This makes
                  them perfect for designs that need to look great at any size, from 
                  tiny icons to large billboards.Vector images also have smaller file sizes 
                  compared to bitmap images, making them quicker to share and download. 
                  They are resolution-independent, meaning they look sharp when printed at any
                   size or resolution. However, vector images aren’t ideal for detailed 
                   pictures like photographs. Because they are made of lines and shapes,
                   they can’t show the fine details, shading, or color blends that bitmap
                    images can. In short, use vector images for designs that need to be
                     resized and stay sharp, like logos and icons. For detailed photos
                      or realistic artwork, bitmap images are the better choice.</p>

            <h2 id="usebitmap" >When to Use<span class = "highlight"> Bitmap</span></h2>
            <p>Bitmap images, also called raster images, are best for detailed pictures like photographs. They are made up of tiny squares called pixels, which can show a wide range of colors and smooth color transitions. This makes them great for images with lots of detail, shading, and gradients. They’re also a good choice for web graphics because they can be compressed to make the file size smaller, so they load quickly without losing much quality. However, bitmap images don’t work well for graphics that need to be resized. Since they’re tied to a specific resolution, enlarging them can make them look blurry or pixelated. This makes them a poor choice for logos or other graphics that need to stay sharp at any size. In short, use bitmap images for detailed photos and web graphics. Use vector images for designs like logos that need to be resized without losing quality.</p><br>

                      <p>To use graphics effectively, it's important to choose the right format for your project. For photos, use JPEG; for images with transparency, use PNG; for animations, use GIF; and for high-quality prints, use TIFF. It's also crucial to find a balance between image quality and file size, especially for the web, where faster loading is important. Make sure your graphics are optimized for their platform—whether it's a website or print material. Consistent design across your graphics helps maintain your brand's identity, and using high-quality images avoids blurriness. For logos and icons, vector graphics are best since they can be resized without losing quality. Keep designs simple and clear to avoid clutter, and always test your graphics on different devices to ensure they display well. Lastly, make your content accessible by using alt text for images and choosing color schemes that everyone can easily see.</p>
