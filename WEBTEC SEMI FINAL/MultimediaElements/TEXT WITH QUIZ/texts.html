It appears as headlines, subtitles, and slogans, sharing important information or supporting other media. By using different fonts, sizes, colors, and backgrounds, text can be used in countless ways. For example, the right font and color can set the mood or create a specific feeling, while background colors can influence the atmosphere.

            <p>Sans-serif fonts are typefaces that do not have small lines or "serifs" at the end of their letters. These fonts tend to appear cleaner and more modern. They are often used in digital interfaces and contemporary designs because they are easier to read on screens.</p>

              <h2 id="kernings" class="highlight">Kerning</h2>
              <p>Kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between individual characters in text to create a visually pleasing and balanced appearance. It ensures that letters are neither too far apart nor too close together, improving the overall legibility and aesthetics of the text. Kerning is particularly important in titles, logos, and other display text where precision can make a significant difference in design impact.</p>

              <h2 id="leadings" class="highlight">Leading</h2>
              <p>Leading refers to the vertical spacing between lines of text. Proper leading ensures that text is easy to read by creating an optimal balance between line spacing and text density. Too little leading can make text feel cramped, while too much can disrupt the visual flow. Leading plays a crucial role in maintaining readability, especially in longer paragraphs or body text, and contributes to the overall harmony of a design.</p>

              <h2 id="trackings" class="highlight">Tracking</h2>
              <p>Tracking refers to the overall spacing between characters in a block of text. Unlike kerning, which adjusts the space between individual character pairs, tracking uniformly modifies the spacing across an entire word, sentence, or paragraph. It can be used to create specific design effects, improve legibility, or ensure consistent alignment in text layouts. Proper tracking balances readability and aesthetics, especially in body text or display text, helping designers achieve a cohesive look in their typography.</p>

                      <p>When working with text elements, it's important to use readable fonts like sans-serif for digital content and serif for print. Ensure that the font size is large enough to be easily read, ideally between 16px and 18px for body text. Consistency in font choices and sizes is key to maintaining a clean design. Contrast between text and background is essential for readability, with dark text on a light background being the most effective. Avoid long paragraphs by breaking text into smaller sections, which helps keep the content digestible. Text should be properly aligned, ideally left or centered, and a clear hierarchy using headings and subheadings will guide the reader. Proper line spacing and padding around the text also contribute to a clean and readable layout.</p>
