                    <p>Also known as sub-framing, this compositional technique uses framing 
                        elements to draw attention to your subject or enhance the visual 
                        appeal of your image. These frames can be natural, like rock formations, 
                        or man-made, like windows and tunnels. Regardless of their shape or form, 
                        they help guide the viewer’s eye to your intended subject, creating a more 
                        engaging and visually pleasing photograph.</p>

                    <p>Framing is a vital element in photography and visual storytelling, offering multiple benefits that elevate the quality and impact of an image. By creating layers within a photo, framing adds depth and dimension, transforming flat compositions into dynamic and three-dimensional visuals. It also provides context, giving viewers subtle clues about the setting or story, which enriches the narrative and enhances their connection to the image. Additionally, a well-placed frame improves the aesthetic appeal by adding structure and balance, making the composition more visually engaging and captivating. Overall, framing is a powerful tool that shapes the viewer's experience and reinforces the message behind the image. </p>

                          <p>For effective frame composition in photography, try using natural frames like trees, windows, 
                            or doorways to draw attention to your subject and add depth. You can also experiment with 
                            foreground and background elements to create layers in your image, guiding the viewer's eye 
                            toward the subject. Additionally, think outside the box and look for creative frames, such 
                            as reflections or light patterns, to add uniqueness and visual interest to your photos. These 
                            techniques will help enhance the focus on your subject while enriching the overall composition</p>

                                use to frame your subject in a photo. Use this frame to guide the viewer’s eye to your subject, and make 
                                sure it adds to the picture without taking attention away from the main focus. This exercise will help
