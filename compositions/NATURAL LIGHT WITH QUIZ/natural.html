            <p>Good lighting is important for creating a great image. It affects brightness, mood, and atmosphere. Natural light in photography refers to any source of light that is created by the sun or moon. Natural light is the most basic form of light there is. The quality and amount of light present depends on different variables, most notably the weather and the time of day. Basically, natural light is used to refer to lights that have not been generated by the photographer's equipment in a photo studio</p><br>

              <p>Contrast refers to the difference between two or more elements, making one stand out from the other. It can be applied in various contexts such as visual arts, photography, or even in weather descriptions. Contrast makes things more noticeable by highlighting differences, whether in color, light, texture, or other features.

                For example, when we talk about the contrast between sunny days and cloudy days, we are referring to the sharp differences in how these two types of weather make us feel, how they look, and how they impact our activities.</p>

              <p>The golden hour, also known as the "magic hour," occurs shortly after sunrise and 
                before sunset, when the sun casts a warm, reddish-pink light. This natural glow creates 
                dramatic, artistic effects, making it an ideal time for various photography styles like 
                portraits, landscapes, and weddings. Unlike other times of the day that may require extra 
                lighting gear to achieve optimal color, saturation, and exposure, the golden hour naturally 
                provides these qualities, minimizing the need for additional equipment.</p>

              <h2 id="highn"><span class="highlight">High </span>Noon</h2>
              <p>Midday or high noon lighting often creates flat and harsh photos due to undiffused light, 
                which many photographers try to avoid. This type of lighting can make outdoor images less 
                appealing by emphasizing shadows and reducing depth. However, it can be advantageous for 
                capturing reflective surfaces like water or glass. At noon, sunlight penetrates water more 
                directly, reducing unwanted reflections and enhancing transparency, which is difficult to 
                achieve during other times of the day when light reflects from various angles.</p>

              <h2 id="blueh"><span class="highlight">Blue </span>Hour</h2>
              <p>The blue hour, also known as dawn, dusk, or twilight, is the brief period before sunrise 
                and after sunset when the sky has a cool pastel hue. During this time, contrast is low, and 
                the sun's rays are still below the horizon, creating subdued, soft light. This magical moment 
                only lasts a few minutes, requiring quick action to capture its beauty. However, the light can 
                sometimes appear overly blue, so photographers often use warm filter gels or the tungsten white 
                balance setting to neutralize the effect and achieve a more balanced tone.</p>

              <p>Night photography poses unique challenges due to the absence of sunlight, but customizable 
                camera settings make it possible to capture stunning images, such as cityscapes and starry skies, 
                often using long exposures. Additionally, nighttime offers creative opportunities for dramatic 
                portraits and glamour shots by allowing photographers to select and control their light sources—like 
                car lights, street lamps, or external flashes—to shape the mood and direct how light falls on their 
                subject.</p>

              <legend class = "legend">TIP</legend>
                      <p>Consider how different types of light influence your 
                        photos and seek lighting that complements your intended 
                        message. If a particular light source isn't working, 
                        adapt by turning off overhead lights, using natural window 
                        light, or rescheduling your shot to a time when the sun 
                        offers softer illumination, such as during golden hour. 
                        For portraits or selfies, opt for overcast days or times 
                        when the sun is near the horizon to achieve soft, flattering 
                        lighting. Indoors, position yourself or your subject to face 
                        a window for natural, evenly distributed light that enhances
                        the subject's features.</p>
