            <p>Space composition in photography is about how 
                you arrange space in a photo to make it more 
                appealing. It focuses on balancing the subject 
                (positive space) and the empty areas around it 
                (negative space). This balance makes the subject 
                stand out, adds depth, and creates a certain mood 
                or feeling.</p><br>

            <p>Space composition in photography is essential for creating visually appealing images by balancing the subject (positive space) with the empty areas around it (negative space). This balance not only makes the subject stand out but also adds depth, making the photograph more dynamic and realistic. Techniques such as layering and using leading lines help create a three-dimensional feel in a two-dimensional image, enhancing its visual interest. Negative space also plays a crucial role in setting the mood of the image; large empty areas can evoke feelings of peace or loneliness, while crowded frames can create tension or excitement. Additionally, effective space composition guides the viewer’s eye, improving storytelling by highlighting key elements and suggesting movement or direction, which makes the image more narratively compelling.</p><br>

              <p class="description">This photo lacks space composition because the subject (man and child) fills the frame entirely, leaving no breathing room or sense of direction. The image feels crowded, and the viewer’s focus is constrained within the frame.</p>

                      <p>To compose an image effectively, position your subject using the rule 
                        of thirds to create a balanced frame. Experiment with negative space to 
                        make the subject stand out and draw attention. Incorporate space to suggest 
                        movement or direction, especially in action shots, by leaving room in the frame 
                        where the subject is heading or looking. Additionally, create depth by including 
                        elements in the foreground, middle ground, and background, giving your photo a sense 
                        of dimension and visual interest.</p>

                      <p>Find a simple subject within the school, like a book, bag, or student, and place it against a 
                        plain background, such as a wall or empty classroom. Leave a lot of empty space around the subject 
                        to create focus and simplicity, letting the subject stand out more clearly. This will help you practice 
                        using negative space to enhance the composition of your photos.</p>
