Before starting a more advanced journey into mobile photography, you must understand your smartphone camera. It is essential for getting the most out of your mobile device.</p>

                <td><b>Focusing</b></td>
                <td>Many phone cameras rely on a focus-free system, keeping most elements in the frame sharp automatically. However, modern smartphones increasingly include advanced cameras that allow users to adjust the focus, enhancing creative control and image quality.</td>
              </tr>

              <tr>
                <td><b>Zooming</b></td>
                <td>Most smartphones feature a digital zoom function that lets you enlarge distant objects. For example, on an iPhone, you can use a pinch gesture to access the zoom slider, while Android devices often have plus (+) and minus (-) buttons for zooming. Unlike optical zoom, which maintains image quality, digital zoom simply enlarges the image, which can reduce sharpness and clarity.</td>

                <td><b>Flash</b></td>

              <tr>
                <td><b>HDR</b></td>
                <td>High Dynamic Range (HDR) is used to capture a wider range of brightness in your photos, making the details in both shadows and highlights more visible. It's particularly useful when your subject is still​</td>
